# Onboard

A quick way to get users into all the services they require.

## Coverage

* Google account creation
* Adding to Google groups
* Invitation to Slack
* Invitation to Jira
* Adding to Github org account
* Adding to Trello org account

## Setup

For setting up users in Google Apps, you will need to have a `client_secret.json` in the root directory. This can be obtained from the [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Your Google account must also allow for API calls within the [Security section of the admin panel](https://admin.google.com/connected-ventures.com/AdminHome?fral=1#SecuritySettings:flyout=apimanagement).

You will also need to add the following envvars to a `.env` file in the root of the project before you build it:

```
// Required for Slack
SLACK_TOKEN - Token provided by Slack for use of their API, must be generated by an administrator

// Required for Trello
TRELLO_TOKEN - API token provided by Trello, must be generated by an administrator
TRELLO_KEY - API key for the API token user
TRELLO_ORG - The Trello organisation you wish to add users to

// Required for Github
GITHUB_USER - An organisation admin that can be used for inviting the user to the Github org
GITHUB_KEY - An access key from Github to allow use of the API
GITHUB_ORG - The Github organisation you wish to add users to

// Required for Jira
JIRA_USER - The username of an administrator for your Jira Server
JIRA_PASSWORD - The password of the above user
JIRA_URL - URL to your Jira Server (including scheme)
```

Once set up, you can just run the following:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Usage

Once the Docker container is running, all you need to do is run:

```
docker-compose run script_host python onboard.py
```
